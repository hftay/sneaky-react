###Sneaky

Sneaky is an app that provides exclusive last-minute entertainment offers to its users.

**Link to app:** [Sneaky](https://hftay.github.io/sneaky-react/#/)

### The problem:
For businesses facing the issue of excess capacity at unexpected hours.
For customers constantly bargain-hunting on sites like Groupon and Catch of the Day (Sneaky focuses on short and "live" deals that are better suited to the business' needs).

### The solution:
Sneaky allows business to reach a large customer base at the push of the button. This provides businesses the opportunity to attract potential customers with special offers and discounts during 'slow periods'.

The approach taken for this app is to provide a fun user experience with a seamless integration from signup to checkout. (Sneaky is still a work in progress)
